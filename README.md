# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
# Overview of the analysis:

This project aims to derive a list of all retiring employees and their titles and then identify the eligible employees to participate in the mentorship program.

# Results:

* Employees with senior engineer titles have the highest amount of retiring employees.
* Employees with manager titles have the least amount of retiring employees.
* 72,458 employees are retiring based on the birth dates from Jan 1952 and Dec 1955.
* 1549 employees are eligible for the mentorship program.

Summary: 

* How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?
           Based on the unique_titles table, they need to fill  25,916 senior engineers, 24,926 senior staff, 9285 engineers, 7636 staff, 3603 technique leads, 1090 Assistant Engineers, and two managers.
           
* Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?
              There are not enough mentors to train the next generation. If the pewlett hackard attempts to fill vacancies with the 1549 eligible mentors, there would be a 46:1 mentor and mentee ratio, which the company has to find more mentors to balance out.

# Two additional queries or tables that may provide more insight into the upcoming "silver tsunami."

The query can be written for employees whose birthday is between 1962 and 1964 eligible for retirement soon.

A table showing employees retiring by the department indicates that development and production teams will see the most significant losses.
